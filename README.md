# Sales_EDA_Project
it is a Data visualization Project
Student Performance Analysis Using Python
# Project Overview

This project analyzes student performance based on attendance, marks, and grades using Python. It demonstrates how data cleaning, analysis, and visualization can help identify patterns and insights in academic performance.

## Objectives

Analyze performance using attendance and marks

Determine pass and fail ratios

Study marks distribution

Explore the relationship between attendance and performance

## Tools and Technologies

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

## Dataset

The dataset includes:

Attendance (%)

Marks

Grade

Ensure the dataset path is correctly set:

df = pd.read_csv("student_dataset.csv")

## Workflow

Load and inspect data

Clean missing or duplicate values

Create a Result column (Pass/Fail)

Visualize data using charts and plots

## Key Insights

Higher attendance often relates to better marks

Most students fall within a mid-range score

Clear variation exists in student performance

## Conclusion

The project shows how data visualization and analysis can be used to evaluate student performance and support academic decision-making.
